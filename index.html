       <h2>What We Do</h2>
       <p>We have a very simple ethos- "Every child is unique and it is our job to help them become their best selves".
        There are two important parts to our set up that allow us to live up to our ethos.

            <p class="mb-5 text-muted">
              We are based in a cosy home in north London.  When children join us the goal is to provide them with a home from home feeling. We have a large play room full of resources for children of all ages to choose from. We are mostly a child-led setting where they are able to decide for themselves what they want to do but we also plan specific adult-led activities throughout the day. All children are assigned a key person who is responsible for making sure they are hitting all their milestones and most importantly having a great time, however most activities are done as part of a group and children will quickly get to know the whole team! Adult led projects are normally based on early years numeracy and literacy and adapted to all levels can participate!

            <p class="mb-5 text-muted">
              As part of the daily schedule we visit a local private wood each day.  With our forest school education we think it's important to give children the chance to explore, play and learn outside just as much as they do inside.  Whilst there is ample time give to free play there are also daily adult-led group activities that the children can take part in. These will always be something to do with having fun in the outside environment, promoting resilience. Whether it's toasting marshmallows on a campfire, making jam or learning to build dens or bridges. We believe that children who have a better understanding of the world around them are able to better understand and cultivate their own interests in the world, whilst also promoting a healthy lifestyle. </p>

              This project was requested by a local tennis club who wanted a striking, one page advert that could attract the attention of potentional female players and allow them to contact the club quickly and easly. This page uses bespoke color grandients, popup mail to application button and is made as "mobile first" responsive webpage.

              Requested by a local school this project uses live API feedback to look up 
              any word you wish. It is a simple, responsive design that allows for images
              and descriptions to be laid out in a clear, comprehensive way. Perfect for 
              learning students who are in a hurry to look up a new word.
